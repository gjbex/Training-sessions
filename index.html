<h2 id="c">C++</h2>
<p>C++ is an important language for scientific programming and HPC.</p>
<h3 id="c-for-scientific-programming-14-hours">C++ for scientific programming (14 hours)</h3>
<p>This training focuses on using C++ for scientific programming and on
the way Bjarne Stroustrup advocates modern C++ in his book "A tour of
C++".  Some C++17, C++20 and C++23 features and third party libraries
will also be discussed.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:
<a href="https://gjbex.github.io/Scientific-C-plus-plus/">https://gjbex.github.io/Scientific-C-plus-plus/</a></p>
<h3 id="c-software-engineering">C++ software engineering</h3>
<p>This training focuses on building applications and libraries in a
professional way using best practices in software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-programming-with-the-stl-and-threading-building-blocks-3-hours">Parallel programming with the STL and Threading Building Blocks (3 hours)</h3>
<p>Out of the box, the STL contains many algorithms that can be run in parallel.
In this training, you will learn how to do that, and what the performance
benefits may be.
Threading Building Blocks (TBB) is a C++ template library for developing
shared memory applications.  It integrates well with the C++ Standard
Template Library (STL) and can be used with any modern C++ compiler.
TBB is especially suited for nested parallelism, and pipe-lining when
part of the application can use accelerator hardware.</p>

<h3 id="fortran-for-programmers-8-hours">Fortran for programmers (8 hours)</h3>
<p>Fortran is used a lot in the context of HPC.  For many, it has a
reputation of being an old and ugly programming language.  However,
modern Fortran is a far cry from Fortran 77 that its detractors have
in mind.  Fortran 2003/2008 is a language that is well tailored
towards scientific computing.  This training introduces the language
and its features.</p>

<h3 id="python-software-engineering-4-hours">Python software engineering (4 hours)</h3>
<p>Quality of software matters, whether you share it with others or not.
Software should be easy to install, easy to use, and well documented.
This training will cover those aspects from the perspective of the
Python ecosystem.  However, it is also important that software is easy
to maintain, so coding style matters, API-level documentation should be
available, as well as a battery of tests to ensure the software's
integrity.  Of course, good design is at least as important.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:

<h2 id="hpc-introduction-3-hours">HPC introduction (3 hours)</h2>
<p>Although working on High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures is
not rocket science, there are still a number of things you need to be
aware of to do so efficiently.  Note that this session is specific for
(potential) users of the infrastructure managed by the Vlaams
Supercomputing Centrum (VSC).</p>
<p>Subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to access the systems</li>
<li>architecture of a cluster</li>
<li>shared file systems</li>
<li>software stack</li>
<li>resource manager and scheduler</li>
<li>accounting</li>
</ul>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>familiarity with the Linux command line</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="best-practices-for-data-science-on-hpc-4-hours">Best practices for data science on HPC (4 hours)</h2>
<p>Although it seems that running data science workflows on HPC systems is
quite straightforward, there are quite a number of pitfalls and best practices
that you need to be aware of.</p>
<p>Subjects:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to fine-tune your data science workflow for HPC</li>
<li>data formats and I/O</li>
<li>distributed computing</li>
</ul>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>familiarity with the Linux command line</li>
<li>familiarity with the basics of HPC systems</li>
<li>familiarity with R or Python</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="container-for-hpc-4-hours">Container for HPC (4 hours)</h2>
<p>Singularity can be viewed as the Docker for HPC, i.e., a Singularity
image contains all the operating system/software components for your
application and can be deployed and run on HPC infrastructure, as well
as on your own laptop.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:
<a href="https://gjbex.github.io/Containers-for-HPC/">https://gjbex.github.io/Containers-for-HPC/</a></p>
<h2 id="workflows-for-hpc-4-hours">Workflows for HPC (4 hours)</h2>
<p>The HPC ecosystems provides numerous tools to help you manage your
workflows.  In this training, you will learn about some of these tools,
and how to use them effectively.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:
<a href="https://gjbex.github.io/Workflows-for-HPC/">https://gjbex.github.io/Workflows-for-HPC/</a></p>
<h2 id="mlops-on-hpc-4-hours">MLOps on HPC (4 hours)</h2>
<p>MLOps is a set of practices that aims to deploy and maintain machine learning
models reproducibly, reliably and efficiently.  In this training you will learn
how to use MLOps tools on HPC systems.  In fact, this training is also for you
if you perform any kind of computational experiments, not just machine learning.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:
<a href="https://gjbex.github.io/MLOps-on-HPC/">https://gjbex.github.io/MLOps-on-HPC/</a></p>
<h2 id="version-control-with-git-4-hours">Version control with git (4 hours)</h2>
<p>Version control is an essential part of the software development process
and is crucial for scientific application to help reproducibility.
You will learn how to use a version control system (either git or SVN)
to document the changes in your source code.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:
<a href="https://gjbex.github.io/Version-control-with-git/">https://gjbex.github.io/Version-control-with-git/</a></p>
<h2 id="generative-ai-for-software-engineering-and-data-analysis-3-hours">Generative AI for software engineering and data analysis (3 hours)</h2>
<p>Generative AI is a useful tool in software engineering and data analysis. However,
if you want to use it effectively, you need to understand the basics of the
underlying technology, and to be aware of potential pitfalls..</p>
<p>After an introduction to the basics of generative AI, various applications will be
demoed, and you will be able to experiment with some of them yourself.  Tools such
as OpenAI's Chat-GPT and GitHub's Copilot will be discussed.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>experience in some programming language;</li>
<li>familiarity with the Linux command line</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deploying-llms-locally-4-hours">Deploying LLMs locally (4 hours)</h2>
<p>Large/Small Language Models are very useful tools in software engineering and
data analysis. However, if you want to use them effectively, you need to
understand the basics of the underlying technology, and to be aware of
potential pitfalls.  In many situations it is useful to deploy a LLM locally,
rather than using a cloud service.  This training will show you how to do that.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:
<a href="https://gjbex.github.io/Deploying-LLMs-locally/">https://gjbex.github.io/Deploying-LLMs-locally/</a></p>
<h2 id="scientific-visualization-with-paraview-2-hours">Scientific visualization with ParaView (2 hours)</h2>
<p>ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization
tools for scientific data.  In this training you will learn how to use
ParaView to visualize your data.</p>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>none</li>
