# demo-magic

demo-magic lets you create scripts that will "type" commands to the screen.
These command will also be executed.  By coding a command line scenario,
it can be used to do intricate demonstrations of command line tools
without the risk of typos.  This can be convenient both for live demos
as for video recordings and screencasts.


## What is it?

1. `demo-magic.sh`: script that defines the functions for magic-demo
   to do its magic.
1. `simple.sh`: very simple example that shows how to use `pe`.
   This will type a command and wait for enter to execute it.
1. `compilation`: an example of using demo-magic to illustrate how to
   compile C code and fix bugs.  Finally, show how to build with CMake.
