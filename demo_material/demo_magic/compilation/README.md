# Compilation

An example of using demo-magic to illustrate how to compile
C code and fix bugs.  Finally, show how to build with CMake.


## What is it?

1. `hello_01.c`: original implementation with bugs.
1. `hello_02.c`: version with bugs fixed, but with formatting
   issue.
1. `hello_03.c`: final, correct implementation.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the application.
1. `compile_fix.sh`: demo-magic script to run the demo.
