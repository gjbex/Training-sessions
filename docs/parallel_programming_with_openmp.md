# Parallel programming with OpenMP (7 hours)

OpenMP provides a very convenient programming model for scientific
applications that run multiple threads.  It is supported by C, C++ and
Fortran compilers.  Its main advantage is that it is mostly used through
annotation of code, which makes it easy to pick low hanging fruit when
starting to parallelize code. The training covers OpenMP 4.5, and
emphasizes pitfalls and best practices.

Subjects:

  * programming and execution model
  * worksharing directives
  * data environment
  * tasking
  * SIMD constructs
  * thread placement
  * pitfalls and best practices

Prerequisites:

  * experience in C, C++, or Fortran.
