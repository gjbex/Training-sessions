# Training sessions

This is a (non-exhaustive) list of training sessions offered on a regular basis
by the VSC, but also to research institutes and companies.

All of these training sessions can be tailored to the audience if required,
and ad-hoc training sessions are possible as well.

For many sessions, a dedicated website has been created that provides
detailed information, as well as a link to a GitHub repository that
hosts the material specific for that training.

For those sessions that do not yet have their own dedicated website,
the material can be found in the training-masterials repository:
[https://github.com/gjbex/training-material](https://github.com/gjbex/training-material)

## C++ for scientific programming (14 hours)

This training focuses on using C++ for scientific programming and on
the way Bjarne Stroustrup advocates modern C++ in his book "A tour of
C++".  Some C++17 features and third party libraries will also be
discussed.

For detailed information, see:
[https://gjbex.github.io/Scientific-C-plus-plus/](https://gjbex.github.io/Scientific-C-plus-plus/)


## Fortran for programmers (8 hours)

Fortran is used a lot in the context of HPC.  For many, it has a
reputation of being an old and ugly programming language.  However,
modern Fortran is a far cry from Fortran 77 that its detractors have
in mind.  Fortran 2003/2008 is a language that is well tailored
towards scientific computing.  This training introduces the language
and its features.

## C for programmers (12 hours)

C is still one of the more popular programming languages today.  It is
probably mainly used for systems programming, but there are also many
applications for scientific computing that have been developed in this
programming language.

Subject:

  * data types and operators
  * control flow statements
  * functions
  * pointers

Python is an all-round programming language that has applications in
many domains.  This training session introduces the programming
language to participants who have programming experience with other
programming languages such as R, MATLAB, C/C++ or Fortran.

Subjects:

  * control flow statements (conditional, repetition)
  * functions
  * data types
  * file I/O

### Python systems programming (4 hours)

Python is a very versatile programming language that has a wide range of
applications.  This training concentrates on interaction with the
operating system, the file system, other applications and the network.
This is useful for systems programming, but also when you want to use
Python as a coordination language for your workflows.
This training introduces modules that are useful in that context.

For detailed information, see:
[https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-systems-programming/](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-systems-programming/)


### Python software engineering (4 hours)

Quality of software matters, whether you share it with others or not.
Software should be easy to install, easy to use, and well documented.
This training will cover those aspects from the perspective of the
Python ecosystem.  However, it is also important that software is easy
to maintain, so coding style matters, API-level documentation should be
available, as well as a battery of tests to ensure the software's
integrity.  Of course, good design is at least as important.

For detailed information, see:

Threading Building Blocks (TBB) is a C++ template library for developing
shared memory applications.  It integrates well with the C++ Standard
Template Library (STL) and can be used with any modern C++ compiler.
TBB is especially suited for nested parallelism, and pipelining when
part of the application can use accelerator hardware.

## HPC introduction (3 hours)

Although working on High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructues is
not rocket science, there are still a number of things you need to be
aware of to do so efficiently.  Note that this session is specific for
(potential) users of the infrastructure managed by the Vlaams
Supercopmuting Centrum (VSC).

## Container for HPC

Singularity can be viewed as the Docker for HPC, i.e., a Singularity
image contains all the operating system/software components for your
application and can be deployed and run on HPC infrastructure, as well
as on your own laptop.

For detailed information, see:
[https://gjbex.github.io/Containers-for-HPC/](https://gjbex.github.io/Containers-for-HPC/)


## Worker and atools

Many scientific workloads are embarrassingly parallel, i.e, they can be broken
down into many independent computations.  Examples of such workflow are data
preprocessing or postprocesing of many files, or parameter exploration where
the same program is run for many different parameter instantiations.  Two
tools have been developed to help you minimize the hassle with such workloads.
This training session will highlight the strength of both tools, help you to
pick the right one for your workflow, and use it efficiently.

For detailed information, see:
[https://gjbex.github.io/worker-and-atools/](https://gjbex.github.io/worker-and-atools/)


## Version control with git (or SVN)

Version control is an essential part of the software development process
and is crucial for scientific application to help reproducibility.
You will learn how to use a version control system (either git or SVN)
to document the changes in your source code.

For detailed information, see:
[https://gjbex.github.io/Version-control-with-git/](https://gjbex.github.io/Version-control-with-git/)
