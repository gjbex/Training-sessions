If you are new to development using Python, you may want to start with
"[Python for beginners](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-beginners)" and
"[Python for programmers](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-programmers)".

It is important that you improve you software engineering skills, so you may want to
follow the "[Python software engineering](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-software-engineering)" and
"[Version control with git](https://gjbex.github.io/Version-control-with-git)" training sessions.

Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries for scientific computing, so you may want to
follow the "[Scientific Python](https://gjbex.github.io/Scientific-Python)" training session.

Since you will be working on HPC systems, you need to be familiar with the
"[Linux introduction](https://gjbex.github.io/Training-sessions/linux_intro)" and
"[HPC introduction](https://gjbex.github.io/Training-sessions/hpc_intro)" training sessions.

Finally, you may want to follow the "[Python for HPC](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-HPC)"
training session to learn how to write efficient Python code for HPC systems.

If you intend to interface Python with C++ code, you may want to follow the
"[Scientific C++](https://gjbex.github.io/Scientific-C-plus-plus)" training session as well.

Perhaps you want to leverage the power of GPUs in your Python applications, in which case you
may want to follow the "[Python on GPUs](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-on-GPUs/)" training session.
