If you are new to scientific computing, you may want to start with "[Best
practices for scientific
computing](best_practices_for_scientific_computing.md)".

The next step is to fammliarize yourself with the basics of working on the
[Linux command line](https://gjbex.github.io/Training-sessions/linux_intro) and
the [HPC infrastructure](https://gjbex.github.io/Training-sessions/hpc_intro).

Since you need some programming skills to do data science, you may want to
start with "[Python for beginners](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-beginners)",
followed by "[Python for programmers](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-programmers)".

Since there are quite  some best practices specific to data science on HPC,
you may want to follow the "[Best practices for data science on
HPC](https://gjbex.github.io/Best-practices-for-data-science-on-HPC)" training
session.

Learn how to manage your code with version control in the "[Version control with
git](https://gjbex.github.io/Version-control-with-git)" training session, and your
data and experiments with MLOps in the "[MLOps on HPC](https://gjbex.github.io/MLOps-on-HPC)"
training session.

Containers are useful tools in the context of data science both to create a
complete, stable and portable development environment, but also as a means to
distribute your software.  For more information on this topic, see
"[Containers on HPC](https://gjbex.github.io/Containers-for-HPC)".

Workflows are essential to automate your data science tasks.  For more
information on this topic, see "[Workflows for HPC](https://gjbex.github.io/Workflows-for-HPC)".

"[Scientific Python](https://gjbex.github.io/Scientific-Python)" will introduce you to the
Python libraries that are commonly used in the context of scientific computing, while
"[Python for data science](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-data-science)" will
introduce you to the Python libraries that are commonly used in the context of data science.

Performance is of course important in data science on HPC, so you may want to
follow the "[Python for HPC](https://gjbex.github.io/Python-for-HPC)" training session.
