# Welcome to the training sessions overview


This is a (non-exhaustive) list of training sessions given by [Geert Jan
Bex](mailto:geertjan.bex@uhasselt.be), either offered on a regular basis by the
Vlaams Supercomputing Centrum (VSC), or on demand by research institutes and
companies.

All of these training sessions can be tailored to the audience if required, and
ad-hoc training sessions are possible as well.

A graphical overview of the training sessions on [computational
skills](computational_skills.md) is availabe.

For many sessions, a dedicated website has been created that provides detailed
information, as well as a link to a GitHub repository that hosts the material
specific for that training.

For those sessions that do not yet have their own dedicated website, the
material can be found in the training-materials repository:
