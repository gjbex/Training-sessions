Many scientific workloads are embarrassingly parallel, i.e, they can be broken
down into many independent computations.  Examples of such workflow are data
preprocessing or postprocessing of many files, or parameter exploration where
the same program is run for many different parameter instantiations.  Two
tools have been developed to help you minimize the hassle with such workloads.
This training session will highlight the strength of both tools, help you to
pick the right one for your workflow, and use it efficiently.
