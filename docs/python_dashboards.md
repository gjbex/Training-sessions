# Python dashboards (2 hours)

Dashboards are a useful way to present data in an interactive way.  They can be used
for reporting, but also for data exploration, or even to create simple web applications.
You can run dashboards locally, or deploy them via GitHub or GitLab, or even on a
server in the cloud.  Creating dashboards in Python is quite straightforward.  In this
training you will learn about several frameworks and their strengths and weaknesses.
