# Parallel programming with MPI (14 hours)

MPI (Message Passing Interface) is the de-facto standard for distributed
parallel programming of scientific applications.  It specifies language
bindings for C and Fortran.  This training covers the MPI 3.1 standard,
but also emphasizes potential pitfalls and best practices.

Subjects:

  * process model and language bindings
  * messages and point-to-point communication
  * non-blocking communication
  * collective communication
  * groups, communicators and virtual topologies
  * one-sided communication
  * shared memory
  * derived data types
  * parallel I/O
  * best practices

Prerequisites:

  * experience in C, C++, Fortran or Python programming;
  * for the section on hybrid programming, notions of OpenMP are required.
