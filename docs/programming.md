Developing scientific programming entails a lot more than simply knowing how to
write code in your favorite programming language. It requires knowledge of
software engineering principles such as proper software design, version control,
testing, and documentation.

If your application is performance-critical, you may need to consider parallel
computing or GPU computing.
