# Python software engineering (4 hours)

Quality of software matters, whether you share it with others or not.
Software should be easy to install, easy to use, and well documented.
This training will cover those aspects from the perspective of the
Python ecosystem.  However, it is also important that software is easy
to maintain, so coding style matters, API-level documentation should be
available, as well as a battery of tests to ensure the software's
integrity.  Of course, good design is at least as important.
