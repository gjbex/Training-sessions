# Best practices for scientific computing

As a scientist, your core business is science, not software engineering.
Nevertheless, having a good understanding of how best practices in software
engineering can help you work more efficiently, or give your work more
exposure is quite useful.  This training is flexible in that it can be
tailored to any combination of C, C++, Fortran or Python, and to many
levels of detail.
