If you are new to software developmentVjjjkkk in the context of scientific
computing, you may want to start with "[Best practices for scientific
computing](best_practices_for_scientific_computing.md)".

Of course, you coding skills should be up to par.  For more information on this
topic, see "[Programming](programming.md)".

Version control is an essential part of software engineering.  For more
information on this topic, see "[Version control with
git](https://gjbex.github.io/Version-control-with-git)".

[Containers](https://gjbex.github.io/Containers-for-HPC) are useful tools in
the context of software engineering both to create a complete, stable and
portable development environment, but also as a means to distribute your
software.

Writing robust code that has been well-tested is an essential part of software
development.  Having tests in place is also essential when trying to optimize
your code.  For more information on this topic, see "[Defensive programming and
debugging](https://gjbex.github.io/Defensive_programming_and_debugging)".

Effectively optimizing your code implies that you have a thorough understanding
of the hardware you are using and how your code interacts with it.  For more
information on this topic, see "[Code
optimization](https://gjbex.github.io/Code-optimization)".

Parallel or GPU computing is often required to take full advantage of modern
compute nodes.  For more information on this topic, see "[Parallel
computing](parallel_computing.md)" and "[GPU computing](gpu_computing.md)".
